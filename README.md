##### My name is Chad Hayes. This page is a collection of some of my projects.


Each project below contains at least one link to a GitHub page which contains a project description as well as implementation details. If applicable, there is also a link to a GitHub repository for a particular project's code.

## Project 1: CS 7650 Natural Language Processing <br> Sentiment Analysis for Earning Transcripts (Financial Data)

This project involved web-scraping transcripts for earning calls for various companies and performing sentiment analysis on the mined text data. We classified how good or bad the earning transcript was and compared the predicted label to the most recent hold rating from stock analysts for that particular company.

Since this project required a report which required answering a number of questions about the project's methodology, we've added the questions as well as corresponding answers to serve as the project description (so the GitHub page is instead a PDF for this project).

### Project Skills
* Programming in Python
* Machine Learning Algorithms (Supervised)
* Natural Language Processing (Sentiment Analysis)
* Scikit-learn & Keras

## Project 2: CS 7643 Deep Learning <br> COVID-19 Image Classification

This project used as input X-ray images from patients with a variety of health conditions (healthy, with viral pneumonia, and with COVID-19) along with modern convolutional neural network architectures to classify the different types of X-rays.

Note this project required a report to accompany the code, so the report below serves as the project description outline of methodology (so the GitHub page is instead a PDF for this project).

GitHub Code: [https://github.com/mliang1987/DL_F20_Project](https://github.com/mliang1987/DL_F20_Project)  <br> 

Note that all code files are Jupyter notebooks (Python). "preprocessing_COVID.ipynb" implements downsampling (as well as some other standard data preprocessing techniques), and all other .ipynb files contain an individual deep learning model implementation (VGG, Densenet, and Xception).

### Project Skills
* Programming in Python
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architectures and Applications (Supervised)
* Scikit-learn & Keras

## Project 3: CS 6491 Computer Graphics <br> 3D Tetrahedron Robot with A* Pathfinding

This project used a tool called "Processing" (which serves a similar function as game engine) to create and render a robot with a tetrahedron core to move around on a canvas. The robot uses modern pathfinding techniques in order to reach the user's current mouse location.

### Project Skills
* Programming in Java
* Computer Graphics
* Artificial Intelligence (Path Finding & Planning)
* Geometry & Trigonometry
* Linear Algebra

## Project 4: CS 6457 Video Game Design <br> Toy Souls

This project was a computer video game created in the game engine Unity. My responsibilities for this project included non-player character (NPC) behavior (also called AI), models, animations, and sounds.

Note the code is in a 7zip format instead of GitHub since this project is rather large. <br>
Download, extract, and go to "Build" &rarr; "Toy Souls.exe" to run. <br>
The code is in the "Assets" &rarr; "Scripts" folder.

### Project Skills
* Programming in C#
* Artificial Intelligence (Path Finding & NPC Behavior: FSM)
* Unity Game Engine
* 3D Modeling & Animations
* Geometry & Linear Algebra

## Project 5: CS 6491 Computer Graphics <br> 2D Well-Structured Vector Field Triangulation

This project also used "Processing" (same as project 1) and an input vector field (a triangle mesh where each vertex also has a vector associated to it) to realign the input vector field so that the edges in the mesh's triangles follow the vector's directional flow.

## Project 6: CS 7641 Machine Learning <br> Expectations Investing

This project used classical machine learning algorithms to aid in fundamental analysis of the stock market. We apply a variety of algorithms with hyperparameter tuning in order to see which algorithms perform better at this difficult task.

Note: a group member does not want to publicly show all code since they plan on using it for personal purposes. Therefore, the GitHub code link is omitted for this project.
